# InfostudApp
The essential app for every Sapienza student

Here we'll publish the source code for the app soon. We have a lot of work to do and we're not pros, so thanks for your patience :-)

If you want to help us in the meantime, write us an e-mail on sapienzaapps at gmail.com !

Update Jan 2021: unfortunately we got stuck because of the current global situation. We were studying the situation of the source code in terms of code ownership and intellectual property. We need to be sure that we can re-license all the work, and this seems difficult now.
